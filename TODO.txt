Roadmap:

X define annotations
X define model
X implement the annotation processor via apt (integrated into javac.exe)
X loading schema properties from properties file
- document supported types and mapping
- make test case
- use codemodel for code generation
- make test case
- make same sample
- javadoc
- support for member class of the persistent bean
- support for field of type enum
- support of date time fields. Support of standard conversion or use a custom converter class
- support for yaml configuration files (by snakeyaml)

Todo:

X optimize test project's settings for path dependency
X optimize test project's sources
- table annotation value for field name prefix to ignore for column name
- store field type for conversion in code generation
- test case:
