This folder contains three projects.

* AndroidSQLHelperTest, the unit tests project
* SampleProject, a simple standalone project
* AndroidSampleProject, a simple Android application using the generated classes

The last two projects contain two modes to invoke the Android SQL Helper:

* by Ant script `build.xml`. 
* by the shell script `storage_generate.sh`
